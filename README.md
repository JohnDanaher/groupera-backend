# README.md for Groupera Backend

## Overview
Welcome to the Groupera Backend! This is the heart of our project, a Node.js API built on Express. Groupera is all about bringing people together, and our backend makes sure everything runs smoothly. Whether you're a developer diving into the code or just curious about how things work, you've come to the right place.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- A soul for coding (just kidding, but enthusiasm helps!)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/groupera-backend.git 
   ```
2. Enter the directory:
   ```bash
   cd groupera-backend
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create & update .env file by copying .env.example
   ```bash
   cp -R .env.example .env

The magic happens on `http://localhost:8080` by default!
